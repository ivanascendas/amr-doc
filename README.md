## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **ascendas** ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use the **agresso-mobile-receipting** mobile application (the "Application").

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about the data our Application uses. By using the Application, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect

The Application uses the audio recording feature for its core functionality.

* **Audio Recordings:** The Application requests access to your device's microphone (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`) to record audio.
    * **Recording Conditions:** The recording of audio (surrounding sounds and voice) begins only after you press the dedicated record button within the Application and stops when you press the stop button.
    * **Storage:** All created audio recordings are stored locally on your device, in the standard system folder for music files. We do not copy or store your recordings on our servers.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected audio data solely to provide the functionality of the Application.

* **Purpose of Use:** The primary purpose of audio recording is to allow you to create voice notes and reminders.
* **Playback:** The recorded audio files are used for playback within the Application so that you can listen to the reminders you have created.

## 4. Data Sharing with Third Parties

**We do not share your audio recordings with any third parties.**

All your data is stored locally on your device. We may disclose your information only if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities in the relevant jurisdiction.

## 5. Data Retention and Your Rights

You have full control over your data.

* **Retention Period:** Audio recordings are stored on your device until you manually delete them.
* **Access to Your Data:** You can listen to all created audio notes in a special section of the Application and on the account page for which the audio note was created.
* **Deletion of Your Data:**
    * You can delete an audio recording directly within the Application **only at the time of its creation**.
    * Once the reminder is saved, the associated audio file can only be deleted manually using your device's standard file manager by locating it in the system's music folder.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our Application is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
